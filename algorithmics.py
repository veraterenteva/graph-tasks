        TODO: Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from vertex start.

        Implementation steps:
            1) Validate start: ensure 0 <= start < graph.vertices.
               Raise IndexError if invalid.
            2) Obtain the adjacency list: adj = graph.get_adjacency_list().
               It is expected that the neighbors of each vertex are already sorted.
            3) Implement standard BFS:
               - Use a queue (FIFO).
               - Maintain a visited array/list of size n.
               - Process neighbors in ascending order.
            4) Return a list of vertices in the order they are dequeued
               (visit order).

        Args:
            graph (Graph): the graph on which the traversal is performed.
            start (int): the starting vertex.

        Returns:
            List[int]: the order in which vertices are visited by BFS.

        Hints:
            - Use deque from collections for the queue.
            - Mark vertices as visited at the time of enqueueing,
              not when dequeued â€” this avoids duplicates.

            4) Return the list of vertices in preorder (first-time visits).

        Implementation steps:
